# Project 2

Luz Dobbins

I picked thses two options because I have had a stroke(minor), heart attack(minor) and have a family history of Diabetes. I would love to see if the predictions of these datasets would help in provid people real life possibilities. That is one of the reason I want to stray in the healthcare/pharmacautical field.

## Metabolic Syndrome

1. Source of data

The data.world site from the preapproved list. https://data.world/informatics-edu/metabolic-syndrome-prediction

2. Brief description of data

This dataset will help me access the proprability that someone will get Metabolic Syndrome. Which could lead to other health conditions.

3. What is the target?

The target is Metabolic Syndrome

4. What does one row represent? (A person?  A business?  An event? A product?)

Each row represents a person who does or does not have the syndrome.

5. Is this a classification or regression problem?

This is a classifier because it's a yes or no question.

6. How many features does the data have?

The data has 13 features. I am not counting the seqn column it is not needed for the prediction.

7. How many rows are in the dataset?

There are 2401 rows.

8. What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling this dataset?

I see that ther is missingt data. I also need to encode the variables and scale the data. I plan on using classifier modeling , tuning of metric models(accuracy or recall) and GridSearch.

## Strokes

1. Source of data

I selected this dataset from the approved list. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset?resource=download

2. Brief description of data

This dataset will access me in predicting if a person will have a stroke based on this specific perameters.

3. What is the target?

The target will be stroke

4. What does one row represent? (A person?  A business?  An event? A product?)

The rows represent a person.

5. Is this a classification or regression problem?

This is a classification because its a yes or no problem.

6. How many features does the data have?

There are 10 featuyres. I am going to remove the id column, it is not needed for this prediction.

7. How many rows are in the dataset?

There are 5110 rows in this dataset.

8. What, if any, challenges do you foresee in cleaning, exploring, or modeling this dataset?

I have missing data to fix and will be imputing objects and scaling the numerical data. I plan on using classifier modeling , tuning of metric models(accuracy or recall) and GridSearch.
