Recognizing preconditions that can help someone with borderline results, thus starting a change in their way of life before they need medical emergencies. I have had a stroke(minor) and heart attack(minor) and have a family history of Diabetes.

This graph shows the difference between men and women and how women carry more fat; some have even higher outliers. We know women carry more fat to help in hormone balance and reproduction.

This graft shows the Blood Glucose levels per age of the patients in this dataset. 

## Metrics
I used the KNeighbors matrics with PCA to get the best score of 82% accuracy on the test data. When I only used the KNeighbors, it was stuck at an 81% accuracy.

### I believe that with more data, we can look at future patient health recommendations just from blood work. 
-I would like to recommend having a Medical doctor look at these findings and work with us in narrowing down what the best test and resources would be to improve the findings. I would love to sit with a doctor to explain these tests better and recommend different items to predict on a model.
-I recommend a larger patient dataset will help these findings; also, for now, Diabetes has been well studied, and recommendations are being made to patients about their predisposition so that we can drop that from this dataset.
